Also provide a short explanation for:
1) How do you decide which links to put in your Frontier list and which to ignore?
Ans:
    Same as answer to question (2) the URL which has highest total score gets crawled first.
    I have a list of domains that are not useful to topic of search. I check if the URL is not from those domains.
    Also I crawl page only if the page is in English.



2) How do you decide which link to crawl next, from your Frontier list?
Ans:
I have written a function to calculate the priority for URLs to be put in PriorityQueue.
The score depends on the keywords present in title and text field of the anchor.
I have two sets of keywords: high impact keywords: if the anchor keyword has any one of these high impact keyword
then it gets multiplied by a high score of 100.
There is a secondary set of keywords that are relevant to the topic, they get a multiplication factor of 10.
The score of an anchor/URL is the sum of scores of all words in that anchor/URL.
The anchor that have maximum score get crawled before other lower ranked documents.
